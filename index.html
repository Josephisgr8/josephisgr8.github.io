            <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring" target="_blank">I find video games very interesting. I am currently playing a video game called <strong>'Elden Ring'</strong>.<br/> 
                I am trying to beat it, as it has been out for a long time and I <strong>still</strong> haven't beaten it.<br/>
                I have sunk well over a hundred hours into this game and have still not found everything.<br/>
                The game is challenging to me, but of course that is just part of the fun.<br/>
                Overcoming obstacles gives a rewarding feeling of accomplishment.
